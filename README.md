This is basically android application. My application name is covid-19 Tracker, which tracks the data Globally
There are 3 sections in my project 

in 1st section it shows data globally with the help of Corona.imao.ninja API.and here is a also used piechart which shows data all active people, recovered people

The special feature of this app is that you can track the specific county data 
so in second section you can  easily track the country data individually 
also you can seach the county from the  country list.
and my third section is that you can choose any country and see the all inoformation a country like 
total population, total death, todays death and so on 


I used technology like - java , android, APIs

IDE is used that Android studio and API is used corona.imao.ninja, this is a bascially free so i choose this API 
also 
i used 3 libraries here 1st is that BlackFizz library for showing piechart and 2nd one is Glide library for showing county flag and the 3rd one is Volley library for Using APIs 
also i am working with Retrofit and okhttp library for Using APIs
also okhttp is one of the best library for me to do work



Advantage is that you can easily see the data globally data within one clicks
.

Disadvantage is that is you can't see tha data by state wise and distrcit wise.
 but i used this feature in futures 
and also you can see the data in the form of graphs with the help of MpPiechart library


This is my first project so only me design the project
 and i have another project which i have done with one of my friend.

The real challenges is that knowing about android technology
i read the android it self and the creat this app 
i have done my project withing 1 month or less than one month
